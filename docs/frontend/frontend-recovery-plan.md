# Frontend Recovery & UI/UX Elevation Plan
**Project:** Multi-Tenant SaaS LMS & Education Management Platform  
**Document:** `docs/frontend/frontend-recovery-plan.md`  
**Execution Standard:** Phase G & H Architecture, `LMS_Frontend_Recovery_and_UIUX_Quality_Gate.md`  
**Author:** Frontend Architecture & Quality Gate Lead  
**Date:** September 30, 2026  
**Status:** APPROVED FOR EXECUTION

---

## 1. Vision & Architectural Purpose

The objective of this recovery plan is to transform the frontend from a generic, AI-patterned functional prototype into a **world-class, high-density, Production-Grade Saudi / Gulf Education SaaS Product Experience**.

### Definition of Done (DoD) per Screen:
No task will be declared complete simply because a route exists or an API call returns data. Each capability must satisfy:
`Capability + Workflow + Real Data + Permissions + UI Tokens + UX Density + States (Loading/Empty/Error) + Responsive + Accessibility + Integration + Visual QA + Evidence`
